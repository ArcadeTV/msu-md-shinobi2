## Changelog 

### Knows issues
* MSU-MD tracks are not stopped because the logic of the game has not been fully understood.
* Due to an update on mister, the functionality of MSU-MD games is varying at this moment. I do not have a mister to test games myself.
* A common behaviour on megaSD is that audio tracks are not looped but instead the next track is played. Hopefully this will be fixed with their next firmware update. I do not have a megaSD to test games myself.

besides that the patch is very enjoyable.
